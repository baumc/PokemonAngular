# Angular C# Competency Project

This repository demonstrates proficiency in **Angular**, **C#**, **Bootstrap**, and integration with external APIs. The project is a web application that utilizes the **PokeAPI** to fetch and display Pokémon data, features a **Bootstrap-based frontend** for styling, and implements **ASP.NET Core Identity** for user authentication and management.

## Features

- **Angular Frontend**:
  - Responsive design powered by [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [**Angular**](https://angular.dev/).
  - Integration with the [**PokeAPI**](https://pokeapi.co) to display Pokémon data dynamically.
  - Organized component-based architecture.
  
- **C# Backend**:
  - ASP.NET Core backend for handling API requests and managing user authentication.
  - Implements **ASP.NET Core Identity** for secure login, registration, and role management.

- **API Integration**:
  - Fetches data from the **PokeAPI** using HTTP client services in Angular.
  - Displays Pokémon details (e.g., name, type, abilities).

- **Authentication**:
  - Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
  - Password hashing and role-based access control using **ASP.NET Core Identity**.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Angular**: TypeScript-based frontend framework.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript superset for scalable code.

### Backend
- **C# / ASP.NET Core**: Backend framework for building APIs and handling business logic.
- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: Secure user management system.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for data persistence.

### External API
- **PokeAPI**: Public RESTful API for Pokémon data.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: For Angular CLI and frontend dependencies.
- **.NET SDK**: To run and develop the backend.
- **Angular CLI**: For managing and building the Angular frontend.


## Usage

- **Authentication**:
  
- **Pokémon Data**:
  - Browse and search for Pokémon details using the PokeAPI integration.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more advanced features like Pokémon filtering and sorting.
- Register or log in to access the application features.
- Expand authentication to include third-party login providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- Improve styling and interactivity using advanced Bootstrap components.
- Implement unit tests for both backend and frontend.
